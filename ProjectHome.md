# JAYU - Java ASN Parser for You. #


---


Jayu is a free ASN data parser to convert ASN.1 Data to CSV format. Jayu can be used both as a command line tool and as a Java library. Jayu is licenced under new BSD licence and can be used in both free and proprietary projects.

Jayu is bundled with [Janino library](http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JANINO/Home) so that it can also be used as a command line tool. If you intend to use Jayu library programatically without the command line utility, then you do not require Janino library.
